What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created. Git starts treating it like a repository and tracks changes if you commit. Otherwise you're not using version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The repository is in the cloud, right? The working directory is on my harddrive and the staging area is space on my harddrive where things are placed when they are heading to the repository. Ugh.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I don't really know what this question is asking... By staging small changes until they add up to one logical change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When working on exploratory/experimental projects. By not directy changing the main branch, collaborators wont be distracted by the wonky changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I dig the one-way arrows. They were particularly helpful for visualizing unreachable branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result is an updated main branch (master) with whatever added feature/fix was being worked on. Because the two branches are coming together.
